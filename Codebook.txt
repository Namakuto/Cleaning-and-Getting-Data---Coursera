Variable Codebook Update for the Human Activity Recognition Dataset
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Description of run_analysis.R 		    Ver 1.0 - June 20, 2017
===================================================================

The run_analysis code will create a "tidy" text file that simply shows the mean time-frequency readings for each activity and measured feature of the UCI HAR Dataset. Standard deviations for each activity and feature are also included.

The dataset is available from: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Each feature variable in the .csv parallels those listed in "features.txt" (refer to the .zip file for the UCI HAR Dataset). Units for measured movements are in s and Hz. Refer to "activity_labels.txt" for a list of activity types. 


Output will be in the format of a ".csv" file. However, the final write line may be changed to a generic write.table function with a .txt file output.
