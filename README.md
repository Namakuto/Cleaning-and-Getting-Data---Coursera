# ReadME for run_analysis.R #

## Ver 1.0 - June 20, 2017
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

run_analysis.R will create a "tidy" text file that simply shows the mean time-frequency readings for each activity and measured feature within the UCI HAR Dataset. Standard deviations for each activity and feature are also included.

The R code should be ready to use and plug-and-play. Be sure to keep the orignal names of the parent directories as well as "child" directories as in the UCI HAR Dataset.zip file.

The .zip file for the dataset is available from the URL below:
